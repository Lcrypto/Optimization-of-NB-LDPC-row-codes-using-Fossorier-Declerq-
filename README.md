# Optimization-of-NB-LDPC-row-codes-using-Fossorier-Declerq
Optimize row non-binary labeling using Fossorier-Declerq approach. Improving of weight spectrum of binary image of row code. According bounds it improve code distance of NB-Codes. Based on part of Morelos-Zaragoza, http://the-art-of-ecc.com/ .


Based on idea from paper C. Poulliat, M. Fossorier and D. Declercq, "Design of regular (2,d/sub c/)-LDPC codes over GF(q) using their binary images," in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 56, no. 10, pp. 1626-1635, October 2008.


In similar way code could be applied to optimization of GLDPC Codes. Because GLDPC is could be view as just relaxed version of NB-LDPC, symbol binary image code be represented not only by companion matrix.
